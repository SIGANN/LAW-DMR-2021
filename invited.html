<h2>Linguistic Structure beyond Strings and Trees</h2>

Abstract: Since 2014, a series of shared tasks at the SemEval, CoNLL, and IWPT conferences has contributed to the advancement of parsing technologies that map natural language utterances to representations of syntactico-semantic structure in the form of general graphs.  Efficient and accurate parsers are available for a broad range of linguistic frameworks and a handful of different languages.  There has been tremendous progress in methods and techniques, even if the downstream utility of these representations, to some extent, has yet to be demonstrated.  I will review some high-level linguistic traits across different frameworks and the evolution of corresponding parsing technologies.  I will further relate these developments to recent and ongoing work on capturing structure beyond sentence meaning in general graphs, e.g. negation or structured sentiment analysis.

Bio: Stephan Oepen is professor in language technologies in the Department of Informatics at the University of Oslo.  He has studied linguistics, German and Russian philology, computer science, and computational linguistics at Berlin, Volgograd, and Saarbrücken.  Prior to his current appointment, he worked, among others, at the German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence and Saarland University (both Germany), YY Technologies (Mountain View), and Stanford University (both USA).  His research revolves around syntactico-semantic representations, parsing and generation, grammar engineering, and grammar-based treebanking.

<h2>Beyond the Mold: New Paths for Annotation Science</h2>
-->

<!-- abstract here
<p>
In the most recent years, the field of computational literary studies has
emerged, sometimes called a ‘little sister/brother’ of computational
linguistics. The underlying assumptions, text types, and annotation categories
pose new challenges to the established annotation workflow. In the talk, Nils
Reiter will discuss two potential  new directions for the systematic use and
study of annotation as a scientific method. Focussing on the text type ‘literary
text', he will discuss the impact of textual characteristics and  annotation
category choices on annotation procedures, metrics, and tools. With an (even
more) methodological focus, he will report and reflect on experiences made in
the shared task SANTA, which at the moment has the collaborative and competitive
development of annotation guidelines as its goal. In both directions, linguistic
concepts interact with non-linguistic ones in a way that can be fruitful for
both fields.
